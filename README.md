# Web Application Vulnerability Scanner  
About the Project  
This project demonstrates the use of cybersecurity principles with Python. It offers hands-on experience with the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. It is designed for educational and ethical purposes only. It can be expanded to support more vulnerabilities, such as CSRF, Command Injection, and SSRF.

## Project Overview  
This is a Python-based web vulnerability scanner that automates crawling, payload injection, and response analysis to find common web vulnerabilities like SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting. It includes a simple Flask dashboard for running scans and checking results.

## Features  
- Automated crawling of target web applications to list URLs and input fields.  
- Payload injection modules for testing SQLi and XSS vectors.  
- Response analysis that uses regex and pattern matching to identify vulnerable behavior.  
- Flask web interface for starting scans and viewing results.  
- Structured logging of findings, including severity, evidence, and request/response snippets.  

## Quick Start (Local)  
1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment (recommended):  
```bash
python -m venv venv
# macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate
# Windows (PowerShell)
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# Windows (cmd)
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```
2. Install dependencies:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the application (example):  
```bash
python app.py
```
4. Open your browser at:  
```cpp
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

Tools & Technologies  
Python 3  
Requests and BeautifulSoup for crawling and form extraction  
Regex for response pattern detection  
Flask for web interface for scans  
OWASP Top 10 as a reference for vulnerabilities tested
